# Analyzing-US-Economic-Data

Extracting essential data from a dataset and displaying it is a necessary part of data science; therefore individuals can make correct decisions based on the data. 
In this assignment, I've extracted some essential economic indicators from some data, and then displayed these economic indicators in a Dashboard. 
I have had the option of hosting the Dashboard in IBM object Storage.

Gross domestic product (GDP) is a measure of the market value of all the final goods and services produced in a period. 
GDP is an indicator of how well the economy is doing. A drop in GDP indicates the economy is producing less; similarly an increase in GDP suggests the economy is performing better. 
In this assignment I have examined how changes in GDP impact the unemployment rate.
